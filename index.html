            <p>Hey Y'all! My name is Jessica Ibarra pronounced (jeh-si-kuh i-bah-ruh). I prefer to be called
                "Jess" because its shorter and I think Jessica sounds weird. Alot of people tend to pronounce my name
                with a
                "Y" instead of a "J," and then attempt to say my last name and completely butcher it. Now that you've
                learned how to correctly pronounce my name, let me share a little synopsis about my wonderful self.</p>

            <p> I'm not the most intresting person but I do know how to have a good time. Let's see, I am 26 years young
                and have been living in Texas all of my life! I have take college courses but decided to make money and
                not finish school . In 2016 I became a mother to the cutie in the picture. Her name is Emma and she is
                my
                pride and joy, my little sour patch kid. Emma is 3 going on 13... send help! Totally kidding, she is
                beautiful, brave, and brilliant. She is what keeps me going everyday and the reason I am taking this
                course. Most days I spend with family and friends. We like to have get togethers, cookouts, go out to
                watch sporting events, concerts or just have a good time. I like to have a good time and love listening
                to a
                variety of music, but don't ask what the songs are called. I most likely will not know unless they are
                one of my favs. I love to travel, I just wish I had tons of money so it could happen more often.</p>

            <p>I currently have a full time job as a Business Analyst for a healthcare company. I have been working in
                healthcare for 7 years. Which is why I am seeking a new career and taking this computer coding course.
                This is definetly going to be challenging but im going to try my best!
